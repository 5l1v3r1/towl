Quick & dirty proof-of-concept code to listen to DNS requests and decode
BASE32-encoded telemetry data.

Dependencies: python2.7, dnslib 
dnslib can be found at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnslib or installed via:
$ sudo pip install dnslib

Important variables to set at the top of the code:

PORT = port # to listen on.  Of course, DNS servers will look for this to be
port 53, so either redirect port 53 traffic to this port, or change this to
53 and run as root.

SUBDOMAIN - the server will ignore queries that don't end in this.  Be sure
it matches both what you've set in the TOWL device and what you have your
authoritative nameserver sending you NS queries for.

LOGDIR - the directory where the decoded DNS data will be logged.  It will
auto-append to files named xyy.log where xyy = the device_id.

** SECURITY WARNING ** 

This is proof-of-concept code.  While I believe it is reasonably safe, I make
no warrantees that it doesn't contain RCE or other types of security
vulnerabilities.  If you are handling untrusted data directly from the Internet
please audit the code yourself or take whatever precautions are necessary before
running this.  I would not recommend running this code as-is in a privleged
environment, especially as root.
