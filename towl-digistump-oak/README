The .ino file in this directory was developed for the Digistump Oak ESP8266
IoT chip.  Implementation notes:

Dependencies:
- Digistump Oak Arduino libraries
- TinyGPS library (https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPS)

Important variables to set in the top of the .ino file:

SUBDOMAIN - must be set to the subdomain/domain name that DNS queries will be
sent to.  This will be appended to each query

DEVICE_ID - this is added as an additional subdomain beneath SUBDOMAIN.  The 
PoC server expects this to be in the format "x##" where x = a letter 
and ## = a number between 00 and 99.  E.g. "a01" or "c55".  This identifier
is useful for telling queries from different devices apart.

HOMESSID - when the device is powered up, it attempts find this SSID first.
If it is present, it calls particle.connect() and waits for seven seconds to
allow an OTA firmware update.  Note - this must match whatever SSID you have
configured in the Digistump OAK firmware in order to work.  If you change one
without the other, you'll have to either change the OAK config to match this
or reflash the firmware from oak safe mode.

GPS_BAUD - set to match the baud rate of your serial GPS.
(Tested with MTK-3329 GPS, but any basic NMEA GPS module should work)


*** NOTE!! ***
Flashing:  THIS DEVICE REQUIRES YOU SELECT "BOARD":
  "Digistump Oak (PIN 1 Safe Mode, Manual Config Only)"

If you flash it with "PIN 1 Safe Mode, Default" then it will reboot into config
mode almost immediately after it begins scanning for open APs.

With this mode you can always revert it to config/OTA mode by tying pin-1 to
ground during power-up, but it won't fall back to that mode automatically if
it fails to connect to your AP once it's running.
*******

Once it's configured and flashed, you should be able to OTA flash it again
by booting it in the vicinity of your home SSID and then hitting the "Upload"
button right after it boots.  But if that fails, you always have the pin-1
configuration mode fallback.  (You can flash it OTA from config mode.)

Have fun!
